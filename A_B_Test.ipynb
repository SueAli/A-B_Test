    "## Experiment Overview: Free Trial Screener\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the home page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\". If the student clicks \"start free trial\", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead.  This below screenshot shows what the experiment looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./Final Project- Experiment Screenshot.png\"  alt=\"new screen\">  </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough timeâ€”without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.\n",
    "The unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page.\n"

(That is, the same cookie visiting on different days would be counted twice.) User-ids are automatically unique since the site does not allow the same user-id to enroll twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of cookies:** That is, number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. (dmin=3000)\n",
    "- **Number of user-ids:** That is, number of users who enroll in the free trial. (dmin=50)\n",
    "- **Number of clicks:** That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button (which happens before the free trial screener is trigger). (dmin=240)\n",
    "- **Click-through-probability:** That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. (dmin=0.01)\n",

    "There are categories of metrices that would be selected before we conduct our experiment:<br/>\n",
    "A. **Invariant metrics:** shouldn't change across control group and experiment group. Afetr conducting our experiment, they will be used to assure the consistency of our experiment design. The main goal of our experiment to show if the \"new pop message\"- that will be shown after user click on \"start free trial\"- might cause reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough time. Based on our change in UI, we should expect that any interaction between user & home page content should be the same. Which means number of page views, number of clicks on \"start free trial\", and number of clicks on \"Access course materials\" shouldn't change across control group and experiment group. So, the selected invariant metrics are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of cookies\n",
    "- Number of clicks\n",
    "- Click-through-probability\n",
    "\n",
    "B. **Evaluation metrics:** are metrics expected to change after as a result of conducting our experiment. Which change we are look for? we expect the users enrollment count/rate will change. So we should find some metrics that reflect and measure those changes. Our hypothesis expect only users with high potential - have more time to work on course - will enroll and enter their payments info. Also, because they know how much time they will need to finish the course, that increase their probabilities to stay enrolled past the 14-day boundary and make thus make at least one payment. Therefore, the selected evaluation matrices are: <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gross conversion --> it refelects the change in enrollment rate\n",
    "- Retention --> it reflect how users retention changed as a result of our experiment ( as it divides #of enrolled users who make at least one payment over # of user-ids to complete checkout). Note: some of users might cancel enrollment before they past the 14 day boundary ( those users will be counted in the denominator)\n",
    "- Net conversion --> it measures if the change has any effect on  overall 14-day completion rate. \n",
    "    \n",
    "If our hypothesis is true, we must observe the following:\n",
    "- Gross Conversion should go lower, as student who likely to cancel their enrollment during 14-day trial boundary expected to be decreased by the new pop screen\n",
    "- Retention should go higher, as enrolled students would not be likely to drop the course and pay at least one payment.\n",
    "- Net conversion shouldn't be reduced. As the amount of students who past 14-day trial and make at least one payment shouldn't be affected by the change.\n",

    "Udacity conducted an experiment to see the effect of studens knowing how much time they need in advance before they enroll themselves in any course. Udacity added a new screen \"Ask student how much time they have available to work in the course\" based on their answer, they will be advised to access course free material, or continue to the enrollment process directly. Udacity student's traffic was diverted equally between two groups: control group (normal UI), and experiment group ( where the new screen was applied). Some invariant metrics were selected to make sure our experiment doesn't have any undesirable changes. Invariant metrics are \"Number of unique cookies\", \"Number of clicks on \"Start free trial\", and \"Click-through Probability\". None of them should be different across control and experiment groups.\n",

To statistically evaluate the metrics, the Null hypothesis is there is no change in evaluation metrics across control & experiment groups. To decide launching the experiment, we expect this Null hypothesis to be rejected for both metrics.\n",

The Gross Conversion has been dropped by 2% in our experiment which approve the new screen has the expected impact in reducing students enrolled without having in front info about time they need to complete the course. But, for \"Net Conversion\" metric \"Null hypothesis\" was accepted and this is the opposite for what we expected.\n",

But it also showed no significant in \"Net Conversion\" - the confidence interval includes the lower boundary (-0.0075) for practical significant - which is not aligned with the experiment 2nd goal. Based on these results, my recommendation is not to launch this experiment."

I believe there are many other reasons that might cause students with high commitment and enough time cancel their enrollment before they past 14-days trial. Some students might leave because it was the first time for them to take an online course and they didn't feel comfortable with online learning process, the course content wasn't what they expected, they are missing the pre-requisite skills, or they discovered they should pay less for the course.\n",
